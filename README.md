XPlay
====
Features
----
1. Xplay uses `NDK Shader` render by `OpenGLES` to play YUV video efficiently, which won't consume CPU<br>
2. XPlay support both `software` and `hardware` decoding and `multi-threads` decoding.<br>
3. Support playing `web server video streaming` (rtmp, rtsp, http)ï¼Œ`Live streaming` and rtsp `camera`.<br>
4. Implement playing audio using using the native interface of `OpenSLES NDK`, don't depend on the third part library.<br>
5. Improve the extensibility by using some popular design pattern, like `Observer` pattern, `Builder` pattern, `Facade` pattern, `Proxy` pattern, `Adapter` pattern, `Singleton` pattern and the `Producer-consumer` pattern for multi-threads.<br>
